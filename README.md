## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the GUI Translator running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gui-translator.git
   cd gui-translator

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:
   - from tkinter import * 
   - pip install translate
   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure that Tkinter is installed with standard python installation. You can verify this by trying to import tkinter in a Python script or interactive session:
   > import tkinter
     print(tkinter.TkVersion)

   > If tkinter is not available or you encounter an import error, you might need to reinstall Python or ensure that tkinter was included during the installation process.

4. Run the main script to start the GUI Translator:
   Language translator with GUI.py
